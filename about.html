                <p><strong>Heated City is a design fiction project</strong></p>
                
                <p>Heated City was not a guide for the average climate tourist. It was not where you would find the best place to buy carbon offsets, book disaster-proof hotels, or highlight the same old resilience initiatives.</p>
                
                <p>From 2028 - 2030, Heated City documented the urban districts around the world where caring became infrastructure—neighborhoods where climate adaptation, community care, and biointegration created new forms of everyday life. It was the essential exploration guide made by and for the climate-conscious urbanites.</p>
                
                <p>Created by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/heated.studio?igsh=MTJveTk5Zm9vYmlqNQ==" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heated Studio</a>, Heated City was a speculative effort exploring how hundreds of communities might respond to climate challenges through care-based infrastructure. Each district represented different approaches to atmospheric coordination, thermal equity, water adaptation, and community resilience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-col">
                <p>Local coordinators documented their neighborhoods with carefully crafted observations so visitors could experience each district like a resident. Whether you explored biointegration labs or community cooling centers, seasonal observation protocols or adaptive housing, we had you covered.</p>
                
                <p>In this speculative near-future, communities worldwide developed innovative care infrastructures in response to escalating climate challenges. Heated City emerged as a way to document and share these approaches—a collaborative mapping of how urban care systems might evolve.</p>
                
                <p><strong>This is a design fiction project</strong></p>
                
                <p>All locations, projects, technologies, and narratives presented are speculative scenarios created for educational and imaginative purposes. Heated City explores possible futures of urban climate adaptation through the lens of care-based infrastructure.</p>
